<h1>FAQ on Publishing Problems (in progress)</h1>

<p class="baseline">Here are some notes to help diagnose a publishing problem
with edit.w3.org.</p>
</div>

<p>Nearby: <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/Jigedit/">Publishing with
edit.w3.org</a></p>

<h2 id="clients">Logs</h2>

<p>Logs can be found at the following locations on edith</p>
<ul>
  <li>/jigedit/trace.txt (history in directory /jigedit/Traces/)</li>
  <li>/jigedit/Jigsaw/logs/log_aaaa_mm, (ECLF format) but not real-time
  updated</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="plans">Global Issues</h2>

<p>In general, we are asked to look at this problem when users got an error
trying to publish a document or when the publication seems ok but the
modifications are not effective in the server version.</p>

<p>There may be different causes to these problems (non-exhaustive list)</p>

<h3>ACL setting (1)</h3>

<p>The directory in which the user tries to publish must have permissions set.
Otherwise, authentication is refused in the editor and a "401 Unauthorized"
message is generated in the logs.</p>

<h3>ACL setting (2)</h3>

<p>When a new document is created, the acl setting is not immediately
propagated to the mirrors, This causes a "403" error when the www.w3.org
version is reached (the edit.w3.org version works well). Wait some minutes or
change the acl with ,access</p>

<p><em>(we are currently investigate this problem to find a fix)</em>.</p>

<h3>Names case-sensitive</h3>

<p>The names of the published documents are case-sensitive, that may lead to
some confusion (<a
href="https://www.w3.org/Help/Requests/Ticket/Display.html?id=7145">typically
'overview.html' instead of 'Overview.html'</a>), as no errors are reported in
this case.</p>

<h3 id="plans1">CVS conflict</h3>

<p>We recently got some sysreqs about problems in uploading documents,
independently of the editor. They resulted in a "409 Conflict" error in the
logs, mostly for new resources (msg 'with a cvs status equals to : Locally
Added') but also for existing ones (msg 'with a cvs status equals to : Locally
Modified').</p>

<p>We are still investigating the cause of this problem. A cvs operation on the
resource or using the cvs form (http://edit.w3.org/address/CVS) should fix
it.<br />
</p>

<h2>Editor specific problem</h2>

<h3>password-in-the-clear with Amaya</h3>

<p>A bug in the libwww caused this problem. The patched version of Amaya is the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/BinDist.html">11.4.7</a> (previous
versions should be replaced).</p>
