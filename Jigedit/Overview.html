<h2><a name="Description" id="Description">Description</a></h2>

<p>edit.w3.org is another way of editing W3C web space. It is a special purpose
HTTP server that allows authenticated users to perform an HTTP/PUT on our
servers.<br />
edit.w3.org is a <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/">Jigsaw</a> server enhanced
with <a href="#expert">CVS functionalities</a>. With this tool you can use the
CVS system through a form interface and therefore edit the W3C web space in a
safe way.</p>

<p>Anyone with a W3C account can publish to W3C web space depending on the
access control (<a href="#ACL">ACL</a>) of that web space. To check the ACL of
a http://www.w3.org URI append ,access to it. <br />
Note not all of www.w3.org web space is open to ACLs and ,access will indicate
so.</p>

<h2><a name="ACL" id="ACL"><acronym title="Access Control List">ACL</acronym>'d
space</a></h2>

<p>Access Control Lists (aka ACL) allow to define flexible and modifiable
access control on a given resource (document or directory). Most of the
directories in our web site are under ACL, especially the directories in the
form of <em>http://www.w3.org/YYYY/</em> (where <em>YYYY</em> is a 4 digit
year).</p>

<h3>What does it imply for the publication?</h3>

<p>You can edit an ACL'd resource if you have write permission on it, or if you
belong to a group that has write permission.<br />
If you are an editor of an ACL'd space, you will be able to update pages. But
if you want to create a new resource in this space, you'll have to ask your
Team contact to change the ACLs for your new resource otherwise nobody (even
yourself) will be able to access it.</p>

<p>The tool ,access (,access appended to an URI) indicates if you can access
that URI. In any cases, ask your Team contact if you have troubles with
permissions. </p>

<h2><a name="Requirements" id="Requirements"></a>How to use edit.w3.org</h2>

<p>There are two ways to use edit.w3.org</p>
<ul>
  <li>Through a tool that does HTTP PUT and that supports SSL: 
    <ul>
      <li>HTML authoring tools such as <a
        href="http://bluegriffon.org/">BlueGriffon</a>, <a
        href="/Amaya/">Amaya</a>, <a
        href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/Winie/">Winie</a>.<br />
        Other authoring tools as <a
        href="http://www.seamonkey-project.org/">SeaMonkey</a>, <a
        href="http://www.kompozer.net/">Kompozer</a>, <a
        href="http://www.ptc.com/product/arbortext/editor">Arbortext Editor</a>
        or <a href="http://www.oxygenxml.com/">Oxygen XML</a> for instance
        also implement HTTP PUT but have not been yet tested with
        edit.w3.org.<br />
        Note that previous versions of Adobe Dreamweawer didn't implement this
        method, recent versions may use it, please verify the available
        features. </li>
      <li>Transfer data tools such as <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>
        or the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WinCom/">libwww PUT tool</a> (no
        longer maintained). </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Through <a href="#webdav">Webdav</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="editor" id="editor"></a>Setting up your Authoring tool</h2>

<p>Among the authoring tools that support HTTP PUT, we recommend using <a
href="http://bluegriffon.org/">BlueGriffon</a> or <a
href="/Amaya/">Amaya</a></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://bluegriffon.org/">BlueGriffon</a> is a WYSIWYG web editor
    that supports HTML5, it is powered by Gecko, the rendering engine of
    Firefox. In order to use the HTTP PUT method, you have to get and install
    the <a href="http://www.bluegriffon.com/index.php?pages/PUTter2">PUTter</a>
    add-on.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/">Amaya</a> is a WYSIWYG web editor that
    natively implements the PUT method but doesn't support HTML5. Note that
    only the latest version of Amaya (<a
    href="/Amaya/User/BinDist.html">version 11.4.4</a>) supports SSL.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if you want to use another authoring tool, you should read this
section. Most authoring tools come with default settings that do not apply to
edit.w3.org.<br />
One of the important things to check for is how the authoring tool handles
images and links.<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Links:</b> the general policy on our web site is to always use
    relative links when pointing to resources within W3C's site. Verify that
    relative links are not transformed into absolute ones when you load a
    edit.w3.org document. Also check that inserted links into W3C's site are
    related to document location (verify for instance that the checkbox 'Make
    URL relative to page location' is checked when you edit a link with
    BlueGriffon). </li>
  <li><b>Images:</b> when creating a document that links to images, the images
    should be available from our web site, links to them should be made
    relative to document location and the authoring tool should not try to save
    them. If new images need to go with the document, verify that the authoring
    tool proposes to upload them when you publish it, or upload them separately
    with <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> for instance. </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="use" id="use"></a>How to publish in W3C's web space</h2>

<h3>Where do I PUT my file ?</h3>

<p>It is simply a matter of mapping the actual URI of the resource into a
edit.w3.org-based URI.<br />
Our www.w3.org servers are set to redirect PUT requests to the corresponding
edit.w3.org URI but if your client cannot handle redirect simply change www to
edit in the URI. </p>

<h3>How do I put HTML files?</h3>

<p>There are basically two methods, depending on what tool you use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With an authoring tool that have HTTP PUT implemented (which is mandatory
    to use edit.w3.org, see <a href="#Requirements">How to use
    edit.w3.org</a>):<br />
    When the document is ready to be published, hit <b>Save As</b> or its
    equivalent (it might be <b>Publish)</b> then, enter the correct edit.w3.org
    location for the document.</li>
  <li>Using <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> to transfer a local file to
    a remote URI is quite simple, you have to use the options '--upload-file'
    (or '-T') and '--user' as follow:<br />
    <i>curl <b>--user</b> name:password <b>--upload-file</b> source_file
    remote_uri</i></li>
</ul>

<h3>What about other types of files ?</h3>

<p>To PUT any type of file (expect php files), you can use <a
href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>. As explained above, it takes a source
file and a destination URI, and performs a PUT.<br />
Team members (and only them for the moment) can also use <a
href="#webdav">webdav</a>.</p>

<p>Any type of document whose <a href="#trouble">mime-type is recognized by
edit.w3.org</a> can be transferred on edit.w3.org.</p>

<h3>What about directories ?</h3>

<p>Directories are automatically created and added to our CVS repository when
needed.</p>

<h2><a name="webdav" id="webdav"></a>Using edit.w3.org through WebDAV</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> is an HTTP-based
protocol that allows accessing the content of an HTTP server as a networked
filesystems; to put it simply, it allows to edit directly a web site as if it
were an additional disk on your computer.</p>

<p>See <a href="Webdav">How to publish with webdav on edit.w3.org</a><br />
(<em>note that webdav is restricted to Team members for the moment).</em></p>

<h2><a name="expert" id="expert"></a>edit.w3.org and CVS</h2>

<p>edit.w3.org is more than an HTTP server with per-user authentication on PUT.
It relies on CVS to provide a history of all the changes. New changes are
automatically committed to our CVS repository upon saving.<br />
edit.w3.org is actually a web-based interface to CVS with PUT capabilities. It
uses forms to perform the most common CVS commands, and all you need is just a
browser.</p>

<p>Basic commands of <a
href="http://web.mit.edu/macdev/Development/Documentation/www/CVS%20Documentation/Working%20with%20CVS.html">CVS</a></p>

<p>You can perform most CVS commands through your browser by calling upon the
CVS form within the directory you wish to maintain. Note that this view also
allows you to bypass the normal Overview page and see the directory contents.
This is convenient for other purposes too!</p>

<p>To access the CVS form in the directory you wish to maintain, simply append
"CVS" to the edit.w3.org URI for the directory. Referring to "<a
href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/Jigedit/#use">Where do I PUT my file?</a>"
above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>http://edit.w3.org/Guide/CVS</strong></p>

<h2><a name="trouble" id="trouble"></a>Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
  <li><i>I get a <em>'415: Unsupported media type'</em> error when trying to
    PUT a document.</i> 
    <p>You were probably trying to PUT a document with an unknown extension.
    Although lot of mime-types are registered in edit.w3.org (html and htm for
    <i>text/html</i>, jpg and jpeg for <i>image/jpeg</i>, png for
    <i>image/png</i>), the extension of the faulty document could be different
    from the one associated with its mime-type in edit.w3.org, or it could be
    an unknown mime-type. In this case, contact &lt;<a
    href="mailto:webreq@w3.org">webreq@w3.org</a>&gt; to ask for the mime-type
    to be added.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>Something went wrong (it hangs, it stopped, it crashed...), what
    should I do ?</i> 
    <p>The first thing to do is to look at the <b>CVS form</b> of the directory
    where you just tried to PUT. It will show you the status of this directory,
    and the <b>CVS</b> status of the files in there, including the file you
    just tried to PUT.</p>
    <p>To access the CVS form for
    <b>http://www.w3.org/Groups/MyGroup/Draft/my_draft.html</b>, just go to
    <b>http://edit.w3.org/Groups/MyGroup/Draft/CVS</b><br />
    There you can see the status of the file you just tried to PUT. If it says
    <em>'Conflict'</em>, contact &lt;<a
    href="mailto:webreq@w3.org">webreq@w3.org</a>&gt;. If it says <em>'Needs
    patch'</em>, select <b>Update</b> then <b>commit</b>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>I've put a new document on edit.w3.org, but when I try to access it on
    the main server, I get a 401 Forbidden. What's the matter?</i> 
    <p>You must be editing in ACL'd space. See the <a href="#ACL">section about
    it</a> and contact &lt;<a href="mailto:webreq@w3.org">webreq@w3.org</a>&gt;
    if it doesn't help.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
