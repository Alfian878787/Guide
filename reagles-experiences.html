<h2>Thoughts from the P3P Harmonization WG </h2>

<p>Joseph Reagle <a href="mailto:(reagle@w3.org">(reagle@w3.org</a>), 16 March 1998<br>
Status: This document is part of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/Overview.html">The
Art of Consensus: A Guidebook for W3C Working Group Chairs and other Collaborators.</a> It
has no official standing. </p>

<p>Many of the following concepts I developed during the chairing and editing of the P3P
Harmonized Vocabulary Working Group (WG). They are based on prior thought, conversations
with <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/reagles-experiences.html#Acknowledgements">colleagues</a>,
<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2418.txt">IETF</a> and <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Group/Draft">W3C</a> process, and some things
I've <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/reagles-experiences.html#Reading List">read</a> over
the past couple of months. Some of this may be typical management knowledge, but given
I've had no formal &quot;technology management&quot; training and this was my first Chair,
I wanted to capture some of what I learned regardless. The W3C is a unique enough place,
that things we learn here probably are not well expounded upon elsewhere. </p>

<p>The W3C's work is focussed on specifications and consensus development between
sometimes antagonistic parties, in a contentious domain. The chair has few management
carrots or sticks available for ensuring the timely completion of the group's tasks. My
experiences here reflect the nature of the Harmonization WG: a working group designing a
policy centric XML/RDF schema for P3P. Many participants were policy experts and had a
less than typical comfort level of using the Internet for online collaboration. The WG
also had many participants representing both privacy regulators and marketers: an
interesting mix!</p>

<p>I've written this document to share my&nbsp; own experience in hopes that others will
share theirs with me. Also, like <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Reagle/work-style.html">my
workstyle</a>, this may be of interest to those that are unlucky enough to be stuck in a
WG with me!

<h2><a name="Document">Document</a> ! </h2>

<p>A WG's confidence in its chair and editor is dependent on their confidence that they
are part of the decision making process and that their concerns are reflected in the
document. </p>

<h3>Do the <a name="Charters">Charters</a> </h3>

<p>While a&nbsp; project's or working group's charter may seem like an annoyance, and it
seems to rob the chair of flexibility, a well crafted charter can be immensely useful to a
working group chair. While we want to be as open and participatory as possible, sometimes
the chair must step on feet; having requirements and expectations documented in the
charter is your tool to managing the group and retaining scope as you move forward. If
scope, goals, and deliverable are documented beforehand, your decisions are less likely to
be seen as whimsical, arbitrary or capricious. Note, there is also danger in creating an
overly Machiavellian charter which the group will resent, or will permit others to
entangle the WG in process. Consequently: 

<ol>
  <li>Do the charter. </li>
  <li>If you can't document a specific (such as a date) at least document the requirement
    (this group must have a deliverable by the time another group starts). </li>
  <li>Get buy-in from your group on the charter and timetable. </li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="Show">Show</a> the work flow</h3>

<p>I took great pains to be as explicit as possible about the changes that happened in my
group. Over 4 months I created <a
href="http://www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Harmonization/Overview.html#WorkingDocuments">16 drafts</a>
and <a href="http://www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Harmonization/Overview.html#Notes">13 sets of
notes</a>. However, the frequent document churn, the occasional missed call and the lack
of collaborative Internet saviness meant that a number of concepts were not properly
synchronized in the combined knowledge of the working group. An unfortunate result of this
is that as the group nears completion, people may balk and say, &quot;when did this change
happen?&quot; Or perhaps as the definition or scope of a concept changes other concepts
dependent on that first will be orphaned. Consequently, I recommend: 

<ol>
  <li>Showing all versions of the document on the <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Harmonization/">group's page</a>. Show which meeting or
    set of notes was the basis for the changes made in the document. </li>
  <li>Show changes from one document to another in a &quot;<font color="#008080">diff</font>&quot;
    color. </li>
  <li>When significant conceptual changes are made, document this in a history of the spec
    included in the working document. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Represent <a name="Contention">Contention</a> </h3>

<p>People are most concerned when they feel there views are not being respected or
discussed. People can be surprisingly flexible if you agree to reflect the fact that there
was contention on an issue but that you must move on. Allow them to help you document the
contention, but place limits on the how verbose their description is. </p>

<h2>Set <a name="Expectations">Expectations</a>! </h2>

<p>Often working groups have to work under extremely tight deadlines while facing
contentious topics. I've found that a working group does not mind deadlines in principle,
but it is hard to achieve it in reality. Members tend to be of a dual mind. While they
want a chair who can bring a work item to a timely close, when it comes to closing the
item that they care about, couldn't they have one more week? This is a natural tendency.
How do you deal with it? 

<ol>
  <li><b>Consider <a name="Time">Time</a></b>: Be pragmatic in your assessment of how long the
    process will take. How long will the group take to: <ol>
      <li>Define what it needs to do. (This often can take a significant amount of time.) </li>
      <li>Come up with a robust set of issues that are prioritized in terms of importance, and
        likelihood of successful resolution in your time frame. </li>
      <li>Address those issues. (A metric of your progress is to keep track of how many issues
        open, close, and the severity of the issues as the group progresses.) </li>
      <li>Close, how much buffer time will the group need? (I figure on 20-40% of what it at first
        seems to take barring substantive issues which can easily extend that.) </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>Dig into <a name="Concepts">Concepts</a></b>: If you can give a topic enough time,
    break apart a concept or issue. At some point, it is often useful to dig deep and tease
    out all of components of a concept. In my working group, one such concept was recipients:
    who is the data is released to? We started out with ambiguous terms such as transfer,
    release, and disclose; but these terms are ambiguous and over-loaded. Eventually, we
    reached a very robust understanding of the concept broken into three parts, 1) who is the
    data disclosed to, 2) are they using similar practices as the original site that collected
    the data (such as &quot;for direct marketing&quot;) and 3) on whose behalf is the third
    party using the data (while a site may give information to UPS for shipping a product, UPS
    can go off and do something completely different with the information, on their own
    behalf.) However, this left us with an extremely complex matrix of options, but at least
    we understood what we were talking about. </li>
  <li><b><a name="Constrain">Constrain</a> your options:</b> In the Harmonization WG, I was
    perhaps too liberal in spending time on creating a complete conceptual model. My thought
    was that we would explore everything, then simplify as we went along, and we did manage to
    do that, but I wish I had made a constraint upfront akin to: &quot;this schema can have no
    more than 7 variables, with an average of 3 values (and no more than 5) per
    variable.&quot; Another way to constrain your options is to create requirements that
    features must be implemented by 1 or 2 prototypes for it to be included in the proposed
    recommendation (IETF style). </li>
  <li><b><a name="Lookahead">Look-ahead</a>:</b> When I try to set scope and constrain my
    options, I consider two classes of topic. <b>Immediate</b>, those things the WG has been
    chartered to do, and must be delivered within the time-frame. <b>Look-ahead</b>, those
    things that are relevant to the work of the immediate, but are not deliverables. I use the
    second class of topics to help <a href="#Concepts">tease out the concepts</a>, and provide
    a high assurance that the first set of solutions are extensibly complete. However, you do
    not want to place them in your critical path. If they are important, they will not
    necessarily get solved any faster by placing them in the immediate deliverables, and it
    certainly won't advance the other problems any faster. I sometimes explain this as,
    &quot;muddying the water won't help you navigate to your goal and faster&quot; and
    &quot;do one thing, and do it well.&quot;</li>
  <li><b>Have <a name="Fail-safe">Fail-safe</a>-solutions</b>: While you may now properly
    understand a concept or issue, this is no guarantee that you have an adequately simple and
    complete solution. In the P3P WG I chaired, a number of concepts were introduced late in
    the process as members joined. The WG members definitely wanted to discuss these issues,
    but some were quite contentious and we did not have enough time for them to be discussed
    to the extant necessary.&nbsp; Having a simple &quot;fail-safe&quot; solution in the
    document that people are somewhat comfortable with helps you in the future when your time
    runs out. This should limit the amount of last minute panic associated with a topic. While
    the fail-safe solution isn't optimal, it doesn't create any &quot;no-go's.&quot; Common
    fail-safe solutions are to make that feature optional, or to merely include an extensible
    bucket which can be filled in at a later date. </li>
  <li><b>Set <a name="mini-milestones">mini-milestones</a></b>: Issue X must be resolved by a
    given date, if it isn't, document that it wasn't given enough thought, but that document
    stands where it is; you fall back to your fail-safe. </li>
  <li><b><a name="Stabilize">Stabilize</a> the document</b>: Define a point at which a part of
    the document, or the document itself is &quot;stable.&quot; Meaning there will be no major
    conceptual shifts or proposals, but that the remaining time needs to be spend clarifying
    and communicating the concepts that are already there. </li>
  <li><b><a name="Stick">Stick</a> to past decisions</b>: On some topics, the group will
    continue to return to it time and again. A good rule is to be open to proposals that don't
    conflict with decisions that have already been made. Proposals that conflict with
    decisions of the WG must be accompanied by new evidence, i.e. evidence that wasn't
    considered in the WG decision. </li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="Participation">Participation</a> </h2>

<p>Sometimes a Chair's biggest challenge can be in getting member to participate in a
constructive manner. Lots of participation is an indicator of a healthy WG, if the Chair
is doing all the work, its management is sub-optimal.&nbsp; I recommend the following 

<ol>
  <li>Encourage proposals, if someone agrees to write up a proposal, document that as an
    action item with a due date. </li>
  <li>Create <a href="http://www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Harmonization/Notes/971205notes.htm">deadlines</a>
    for proposals, particularly proposals that will be discussed at a face-to-face. By
    allowing your working group to participate in and provide buy-in on the timetable and
    charter, they will feel more committed to the timetable than if you set the deadlines
    yourself. </li>
  <li>Optionally, publish statistics on posts to the list as an indication of participation.
    Use this at some point to determine who will be listed as a contributor. </li>
</ol>

<p>My understanding of the W3C process is that you cannot exclude or limit membership to a
working group, however I think this can be problematic. I believe the benefits of limiting
membership is some instances can include: 

<ul>
  <li><b>strong culture</b>: defining a point at which you will determine who the contributors
    are or purge the mail list sets expectations and cultivates a strong culture of
    participation in that if you aren't working, you won't be listed as a contributor. </li>
  <li><b>stability</b>: it prevents new or non-participating members on a mailing list from
    ignoring the work of the group until the last minute and then upsetting the balance you've
    worked to achieve. </li>
</ul>

<p>I also believe that many working groups should be public, benefits can include:

<ul>
  <li><strong>public buy-in</strong>: since the community can watch and participate, the forum
    has a higher legitimacy. A public WG will behave much like a Member only one, there are
    those that propose, those that comment, and those that watch.</li>
  <li><strong>serendipitous contribution</strong>: folks you never heard of will contribute
    great comments and implementations.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, when your work is complete, it is good to show that your work enjoys <b>support</b>
from as many members as possible. Some members may only wish to lurk and make a small
comment every once in a while, and this is a perfectly legitimate role. </p>

<h3>The <a name="Times">Times</a> of Teleconferences </h3>

<p>The W3C is a global organization. Consequently you are going to have to be sensitive to
the concerns of people calling in from around the world. Furthermore, when a group starts,
it can be very difficult to pin down a time that is best for everyone. There is rarely a
solution that works for everyone, but I find that if you do your best, and have calls at a
consistent time, people can schedule around you, and after a while, that time become a
fixed part of calendar in which participants won't schedule conflicts. </p>

<h3><a name="Agendas">Agendas</a> </h3>

<p>An agenda for a call or meeting is essential. It acts as the guide by which you measure
whether you are achieving what you need to do to make the call productive. It 

<ul>
  <li>establishes a work plan for the meeting, </li>
  <li>keeps people focused, and </li>
  <li>determines if there is enough open issues and action items to justify the meeting. </li>
</ul>

<p>At the W3C, people often like to set the agenda by 1) issues not closed from the last
meeting and 2) new things raised on the mailing list. The relationship of setting the
agenda with the mailing list is important, it encouraging participation throughout the
week, rather than ad-hoc and last minute concerns being raised during the meetings. You
may even wish to allocate time to the topics, making it clear that if people do want to
raise an issue, they will have to raise it on the list first. </p>

<h2>Facilitating <a name="Consensus">Consensus</a> </h2>

<p>Consensus is a significant enough issue that it bears repeating from the Process
Document: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Integral to the W3C process is the notion of <i>consensus</i>. The W3C process requires
  those who are considering an issue to address all participants' views and objections and
  strive to resolve them. Consensus is established when substantial agreement has been
  reached by the participants. Substantial agreement means more than a simple majority, but
  not necessarily unanimity. In some circumstances, consensus is achieved when the minority
  no longer wishes to articulate its objections. When disagreement is strong, the opinions
  of the minority should be recorded alongside those of the majority. </p>
  <p>Groups strive to reach consensus in order to provide a single solution acceptable to
  the market at large. If a group makes a decision that causes the market to fragment --
  despite consensus by those participating in the decision -- the decision does not reflect
  a single market and therefore the group has failed to reach true consensus. </p>
  <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Group/Draft.html#Consensus">Section
  &quot;1.3 W3C's consensus policy&quot; W3C Process.</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Plug and Play <a name="Proposals">Proposals</a> </h3>

<p>I am a big believer in put up or shut up. If people are arguing over something in your
current working draft and the conversation seems to be going no where, ask the people to
make specific proposals that change the document at hand; this limits unformed rants and
tele-kibitzing. Consider the following text taken from <a
HREF="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/HTML-WG/">http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/HTML-WG/</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Proposing New Features <ul>
    <li>Those who would propose new features or modify old ones are urged to discuss their ideas
      with experienced HTML implementors before going public. In any case, the following issues
      should be addressed in any proposal: </li>
    <li>a statement of the problem as you see it </li>
    <li>a proposed solution </li>
    <li>a demonstration that this solution is globally cost-effective without being locally
      prohibitive (i.e. the sum of all the effort of deploying this solution is less than the
      cost of dealing with the problem with existing technology, and yet no one party bears too
      much of the burden. For example, if you require every information provider to do
      something, it had better be minimal.) </li>
    <li>a discussion of graceful deployment and interoperability issues. </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Purposeful <a name="Discussions">Discussions</a> </h3>

<p>Your want your WG's calls and meetings to be productive. Three ways in which meetings
seem unproductive are: 

<ol>
  <li><b>hesitation</b>: dead air on the telephone, or a chair who can't determine or keep a
    consistent protocol for allowing people to speak around the table. Let people know what
    the protocol is (left to right, raised hands on IRC channel) and the group will do the
    work of self enforcing it. </li>
  <li><b>rambling</b>: on telephones -- without the context of body language or eye contact --
    people are often frightfully unaware of how uninterested the group is in what they are
    saying or of how long they have been talking. Some exhibit this in face-to-face meeting
    even! As a chair you have to minimize rambling. Even set time-outs, &quot;ok, everybody
    give me their one minute on this issue.&quot; A IRC channel is a useful device for
    out-of-band issue queuing. </li>
  <li><b>purposeless</b>: sometimes you may have a meeting in which everyone had a good time
    talking, or they were bored, but in either case, nothing got done. Have a goal in mind for
    what you want to achieve in the group, and hopefully at the end of the meeting there is a
    good set of action items. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Good <a name="Questions">Questions</a> </h3>

<p>Way to avoid the above pitfalls is to structure conversations with <em>good</em>
questions. Long meetings and teleconferences are particularly prone to going off topic.
Structure the conversations with constructive questions. In P3P, there was the issue of
whether there was consensus on whether a concept like &quot;access&quot; should be
included. I broke this into three questions and did a quick pole: 

<ol>
  <li>Is this concept an important one and one people want to spend time on? [poll members
    around the phone.] </li>
  <li>Is this concept defined well, do we offer a good solution? [poll members around the
    phone.] </li>
  <li>Should this be required or optional? [poll members around the phone.] </li>
</ol>

<p>Very often, without splitting these questions out, the conversation will take a lot of
time without arriving at any answer. Sometimes, members may say, &quot;yes, this concept
is important and that is why it must be specified as required in this particular
way.&quot; Use discipline and say, &quot;ok, I take that as a yes, we'll deal with the
issue of requirements shortly.&quot; I actually formalized this somewhat in a <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Harmonization/Overview.html#Consensus">prioritization
exercise</a>, asking people to prioritize and choose one proposal over another. Prior to a
call or meeting, it is always good to have a sense of what issues you want addressed, what
questions need to be asked, and even what answers you'd like to see considered. The WG
will often come up with something better than what you thought of, but if you have
something in mind, at least you have a set of options and semi-consistent result.</p>

<h3><a name="Implementations">Implementations</a> </h3>

<p>While no one in my group was writing code, I did want to see how the vocabulary could
be used in practice, and see who was willing to step up to the plate and do some real
thinking. Consequently, I asked the group to <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/www.w3.org/P3P/Group/Harmonization/Overview.html#Example">write
up</a> their own privacy statements in the language we were developing. This was really
quite useful. I had planned to do this, but had forgotten to and hadn't looked at my
calendar in a while, fortunately a member had the same idea independent of me. Place
implementation milestones and exercises on your timetable so others can remind you! In
more technical WGs implementation feedback is absolutely critical.</p>

<h2><a name="Requirements">Requirements</a> </h2>

<p>Requirements capture many of the issues above, requirements: 

<ol>
  <li>Document the status of an issue in a group, particularly its importance. </li>
  <li>Set expectations about what exactly the group is doing. </li>
  <li>Help facilitate a consensus, rather than arguing whether a concept should be addressed
    at all, turning the conversation to whether the concept should be optional or required
    gives you some wiggle room for negotiation. </li>
</ol>

<p>Explain to your group what the requirements are expressed over and give people a sense
of what &quot;consensus&quot; means.&nbsp; Since P3P enables data to be collected in a way
that can be abused, requirements in my group were expressed over policy: which concepts
must to disclosed in order to request data? Even though I initiated the concept of
(required | optional) for diplomatic purposes, I am still uncomfortable with the result
and believe that usually requirements should be expressed over characteristics likely to
effect interoperability. </p>
