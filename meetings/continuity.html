      <h2 id='status'>Status</h2>
      <p>This is a work-in-progress, started in February 2020.  Comments may be made in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/Guide/issues">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
      <h2 id='purpose'>Purpose</h2>

      <p>
            With travel restrictions, the world
            relies even more on online communication/interaction and the World Wide Web is a crucial part of the human society.
      </p>
      <p>
            This document outlines plans to continue W3C activities while
            travel restrictions and isolation protocols limit the ability of W3C
            community members to participate in-person in W3C meetings,
            <a href='https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/8376'>including
            the W3C Staff</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id='policy'>General policy for W3C meetings</h2>

      <p>
            Meeting face-to-face is an important component of the work for some of our Groups. It enables Group chairs to:
      </p>
      <ol>
            <li>set an alternative dynamic compared to interactions by email/Github or during teleconferences</li>
            <li>Focus on a set of issues and goals instead of being distracted;</li>
            <li>Bring to closure hard issues that have been languishing for months due to lack of consensus.</li>
      </p>

      <dl>
            <dd>We expect Chairs to replace in-person meetings with virtual
            presence meetings rather than simply canceling their in-person meetings.</dd>
      </dl>
	<p>The W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a> applies to 
								all W3C meetings, no matter their format.</p>							

      <h2 id='types'>Different meetings</h2>

      <p>
            We encounter several types of in-person meetings at W3C:
      </p>
      <ol>
            <li>Group face-to-face meetings;</li>
            <li>Workshops;</li>
            <li>Plenary meetings;</li>
            <li>Steering Committee meetings;</li>
            <li>Advisory Committee meetings.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class='note'>
		Note: <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-ac-members/2020JanMar/0025.html">AC 2020</a> will be a distributed meeting and <a href='https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-ac-members/2019JulSep/0036.html'>TPAC 2020</a> is, as of 13 March 2020, happening as planned,

      <h3 id='sessions'>Virtual presence meetings</h3>
      <p>
            Agenda items during virtual presence meetings could take several following forms. The list below proposes different methods
            of replacement in lieu of in-person meetings.
      </p>
      <dl>
            <dt>Discussion-only sessions</dt>
            <dd>
                  <p>Intended for agenda items requiring only discussions (such as specification issues or panels).
                  Those should be replaced by dedicated discussion with virtual presence, possibly clustered.
                  </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Presentation+discussion sessions</dt>
            <dd>
                  <p>Intended for agenda items requiring a presentation first, followed by a discussion (such
                        as technical proposals or position papers).
                  Those <em>should</em> be replaced by pre-recording the presentation(s) with slides at least 24 hours
                  before the discussion (to avoid burden on non-timezone friendly participants).
                  Then, the participants can then have one or more dedicated discussion with virtual presence.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt>Update sessions</dt>
            <dd>
                  <p>Intended for agenda items to update the participants on specific items (such as implementation reports or
                        editor updates).
                  Those <strong>should</strong> be replaced by pre-recording the presentation(s) with slides, with possibly <em>one</em>
                  teleconference to allow for questions, clustering the updates together. You <em>MAY</em> however
                  differ those sessions depending on the important of the topic.</p>
                  </p>
            </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
            For all types of sessions, the Chairs should also allow asynchronous feedback and discussions,
            using GitHub issues, emails, or other forms of input before and after a virtual presence meeting, or between days in the case of a multi-day meeting.
      </p>

      <h2 id='virtualPresence'>Arrangements for Virtual Presence</h2>

      <p>
            Virtual presence meetings occurs when all or some of the participants are attending remotely.
      </p>

      <p id='videoconferencing'><span class='subtopic'>Video Conferencing</span>
	    Groups should plan to make extensive use of video conferencing services
            for those unable to travel.&nbsp; In the case of travel restrictions
	    for some but not all participants, some participants may wish to gather
	    in hubs.  When such gatherings occur, a local facilitator at each hub
	    should assure equitable participation by all through good communication
	    and participation practices; e.g. no "side conversations" even if muted.
	    Every effort must be made to put all the meeting participants on equal
          terms whether they are at a hub or participating outside of a hub. It is
          however acceptable to continue to have social hub gatherings outside of
          the meeting.
      </p>
      <p id='scheduling'><span class='subtopic'>Scheduling</span>
	    Groups should give consideration to scheduling their meeting(s) in a
            timezone that works for the majority of the attendees.&nbsp; As
            participants will be working in their local timezones, what is "workable"
            will vary with individual circumstances, including sensitivity to
            work-from-home environments and non-participant colleagues who may not be
            aware that the participant is "away" even if they are physically in their
            office.</p>

      <p>Meeting duration should be limited to 4 hours per day; consider two
            90-minute segments with an hour break between them.&nbsp; That break can
            be used by the participants for "hallway" conversations, arranged on
            separate conference channels.</p>

      <p id='materials'><span class='subtopic'>Materials</span>
	    Presenters are even more strongly encouraged to distribute (post to the
            Web) presentation materials in advance of the meeting to allow
            participants to avoid using extra download bandwidth during the meeting.</p>
      <p id='video'><span class='subtopic'>Video</span>
	    Video cameras are <strong>strongly</strong> encouraged; this improves the sense of being
            together.&nbsp; Groups may prefer to use teleconferencing services that
            allow each participant to choose not to receive video streams if their
            network becomes saturated.
	    However, any discussion content that is shared via video, including
	    screen sharing, must be made <a href='https://www.w3.org/WAI/'>accessible</a> by some means to those who cannot
	    -- or choose not to -- use the video feed.</p>
      <p id='accessibility'><span class='subtopic'>Accessibility</span>
	    Ensure that virtual presence meetings are 
	    <a href='https://www.w3.org/WAI/'>accessible</a> for all 
	    participants.</p>
      <p id='testing'><span class='subtopic'>Testing</span> 
	    Participants should be offered testing opportunities to assure their
            local equipment is operational and their bandwidth adequate.</p>

      <h2 id='workshops'>W3C Workshops</h2>

      <p>
            We intend to plan fully distributed <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#GAEvents">workshops</a> with virtual presence sessions. 
		We will both adapt the existing model (program committee issues call for participation
		and invites presentations based on submitted position statements) and experiment with new models.
		In any format, materials should be posted and archived accessibly. Participants should be notified of plans for audio/video recording and confidentiality level.
      </p>
      <p>												 
	Workshops are often key gathering spots for consideration of new ideas,
        with a mix of prepared presentation, pre-determined or self-organizing breakout sessions, 
        and the all-important "hallway track" opportunity for side conversations. 
	Organizers are enouraged to replicate this mix in virtual meetings. Some proposals include:
	<ul><li>Distributed breakouts: break into parallel channels with distinct videoconference lines (or zoom's "breakout" feature) and report back
	<li>Lightning talks: invite attendees to give short (3-min) video presentations introducing themselves. These may be topical or highlight a side interest.
	<li>open mic breaks: leave the videoconference bridge open during breaks, and encourage attendees to chat and start side channels to continue discussions of shared interest.     
	 <li>... additional suggestions welcome to the Strategy team</ul>				     
					     
					     </p>
					     

      <h2 id='ac_meeting'>W3C AC Meeting</h2>

      <p>The Advisory Committee meeting has provided for remote participation for
            many years.&nbsp; We have <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-ac-members/2020JanMar/0025.html">announced</a> that the May 2020 meeting will be fully distributed; we should
            (will) assign someone the role of administrative "host" of the meeting;
            identifying all participants in both irc and the teleconferencing service
            and assuring that all audio channels other than the chair and presenter
            are muted when not in active conversation.

      <p>Presenters will be expected to pre-record their presentations and meeting
	attendees will be expected to prepare for the meeting by viewing those
	recordings.  W3C staff will provide assistance in making the recordings
	and will arrange to have captions added.  Staff will also investigate the
	feasibility of having the captions translated to other languages.</p>

      <p>Each presentation will be accompanied by a WBS form for submitting
	questions and comments in advance.</p>

      <p>As is our standard practice, the presentation slides should also be posted
	in the Web to allow the meeting participants to quickly cite and call up
	a specific slide.  These slides should be posted in the Web at the same time
	the recording is posted.  The captioning should add "[next slide]" text
	to allow use of assistive technology with the posted slides in combination
	with the recorded captions.</p>

      <p>Given pre-recorded presentations, the bulk of the synchronous meeting time
	should be devoted to Q&amp;A.  The presenter may do a brief (~3 minute)
	recap of the material that was presented via recording but should present
	only a single slide on which the discussion points are all summarized.
	The presenter should use the WBS input to inform this recap and to address
      questions and comments that were submitted in advance.</p>

      <p>High quality real-time captioning of the meeting should be provided
      in more than one language.</p>

      <p>Hand-raising will be supported exclusively via irc.  Hand-raising
	features of the teleconference system should be disabled (preferable)
	or (less preferable) be bridged to irc.</p>

      <p>
            Special guests are still welcome in the meeting, upon approval of the Chair
            of the Advisory Committee meeting. Recordings <em>may</em> be available for a limited time for
            special guests.
