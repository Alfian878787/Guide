      <h2 id='status'>Status</h2>
      <p>This is a work-in-progress, started in February 2020.  Comments may be made in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/Guide/issues">GitHub repo</a>.</p>                             
      <h2 id='purpose'>Purpose</h2>
      <p>This document outlines contingency plans in the event that
            (international) travel restrictions seriously limit the ability of W3C
            community members to participate in-person in W3C meetings.</p>
      <h2>Arrangements for Virtual Presence</h2>
      <p>Groups should plan to make extensive use of video conferencing services
            for those unable to travel.&nbsp; In the case of travel restrictions
	    for some but not all participants, some participants may wish to gather
	    in hubs.  When such gatherings occur, a local facilitator at each hub
	    should assure equitable participation by all through good communication
	    and participation practices; e.g. no "side conversations" even if muted.
	    Every effort must be made to put all the meeting participants on equal 
	    terms whether they are at a hub or participating outside of a hub.</p>
      <p>Groups should give consideration to scheduling their meeting(s) in a
            timezone that works for the majority of the attendees.&nbsp; As
            participants will be working in their local timezones, what is "workable"
            will vary with individual circumstances, including sensitivity to
            work-from-home environments and non-participant colleagues who may not be
            aware that the participant is "away" even if they are physically in their
            office.</p>
      <p>Presenters are even more strongly encouraged to distribute (post to the
            Web) presentation materials in advance of the meeting to allow
            participants to avoid using extra download bandwidth during the meeting.</p>
      <p>Video cameras are encouraged; this improves the sense of being
            together.&nbsp; Groups may prefer to use teleconferencing services that
            allow each participant to choose not to receive video streams if their
            network becomes saturated.</p>
      <p>Participants should be offered testing opportunities to assure their
            local equipment is operational.</p>
      <p>Meeting duration should be limited to 4 hours per day; consider two
            90-minute segments with an hour break between them.&nbsp; That break can
            be used by the participants for "hallway" conversations, arranged on
            separate conference channels.</p>
      <p class="issue">
	Such a restriction is problematic for mixed-mode meetings; if
	some participants have traveled to a single location they will
	want to meet for longer periods.
      </p>

      <h2 id='ac_meeting'>W3C AC Meeting</h2>
      <p>The Advisory Committee meeting has provided for remote participation for
            many years.&nbsp; If this meeting becomes fully virtual then we should
            (will) assign someone the role of administrative "host" of the meeting;
            identifying all participants in both irc and the teleconferencing service
            and assuring that all audio channels other than the chair and presenter
            are muted when not in active conversation.

      <p>Presenters will be expected to pre-record their presentations and meeting
	attendees will be expected to prepare for the meeting by viewing those
	recordings.  W3C staff will provide assistance in making the recordings
	and will arrange to have captions added.  Staff will also investigate the 
	feasibility of having the captions translated to other languages.</p>

      <p>Each presentation will be accompanied by a WBS form for submitting
	questions and comments in advance.</p>

      <p>As is our standard practice, the presentation slides should also be posted 
	in the Web to allow the meeting participants to quickly cite and call up
	a specific slide.  These slides should be posted in the Web at the same time
	the recording is posted.  The captioning should add "[next slide]" text
	to allow use of assistive technology with the posted slides in combination 
	with the recorded captions.</p>

      <p>Given pre-recorded presentations, the bulk of the synchronous meeting time
	should be devoted to Q&amp;A.  The presenter may do a brief (~3 minute)
	recap of the material that was presented via recording but should present
	only a single slide on which the discussion points are all summarized.
	The presenter should use the WBS input to inform this recap and to address
	questions and comments that were submitted in advance.</p>

      <p>Hand-raising will be supported exclusively via irc.  Hand-raising
	features of the teleconference system should be disabled (preferable) 
	or (less preferable) be bridged to irc.</p>
