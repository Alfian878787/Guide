      <h2 id='status'>Status</h2>
      <p>This is a work-in-progress, started in February 2020.  Comments may be made in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/Guide/issues">GitHub repo</a>.</p>                             
      <h2 id='purpose'>Purpose</h2>
      <p>This document outlines contingency plans in the event that
            (international) travel restrictions seriously limit the ability of W3C
            community members to participate in-person in W3C meetings.</p>
      <h2>Arrangements for Virtual Presence</h2>
      <p>Groups should plan to make extensive use of video conferencing services
            for those unable to travel.&nbsp; If a substantial number of participants
            are unable to travel the group is encouraged to conduct the meeting
            entirely by video conference, avoiding even local "hubs".&nbsp; The goal
            is to put all the meeting participants on equal terms.</p>
      <p>Groups should give consideration to scheduling their meeting(s) in a
            timezone that works for the majority of the attendees.&nbsp; As
            participants will be working in their local timezones, what is "workable"
            will vary with individual circumstances, including sensitivity to
            work-from-home environments and non-participant colleagues who may not be
            aware that the participant is "away" even if they are physically in their
            office.</p>
      <p>Presenters are even more strongly encouraged to distribute (post to the
            Web) presentation materials in advance of the meeting to allow
            participants to avoid using extra download bandwidth during the meeting.</p>
      <p>Video cameras are encouraged; this improves the sense of being
            together.&nbsp; Groups may prefer to use teleconferencing services that
            allow each participant to choose not to receive video streams if their
            network becomes saturated.</p>
      <p>Participants should be offered testing opportunities to assure their
            local equipment is operational.</p>
      <p>Meeting duration should be limited to 4 hours per day; consider two
            90-minute segments with an hour break between them.&nbsp; That break can
            be used by the participants for "hallway" conversations, arranged on
            separate conference channels.</p>
      <h2 id='ac_meeting'>W3C AC Meeting</h2>
      <p>The Advisory Committee meeting has provided for remote participation for
            many years.&nbsp; If this meeting becomes fully virtual then we should
            (will) assign someone the role of administrative "host" of the meeting;
            identifying all participants in both irc and the teleconferencing service
            and assuring that all audio channels other than the chair and presenter
            are muted when not in active conversation.&nbsp; The presenter's slides
            may be shared over the teleconference system but, as is our standard
            practice, should be posted in the Web before the start of the
            presentation.</p>
