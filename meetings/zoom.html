      <p>
        W3C benefits from <a href='http://kb.mit.edu/confluence/x/rYCqCQ'>MIT institutional licenses for Zoom services</a> and
        Groups may use those with assistance from the W3C Team.
        We do attempt to mitigate the above concerns on those services by setting options and provide usage guidelines.

      <h2 id='scheduling'>Scheduling a Zoom Conference</h2>

      <p>
        The Zoom scheduler limits how far into the future a recurring meeting may be scheduled. However, you can
        extend the end date after some time has passed. If you schedule a recurring meeting with a password, that appears
        to create a "drop-in room" at that meeting number that works at any time, not just the time for which you have
        specifically scheduled the meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recurring meetings can be used at any time and are not limited to a scheduled period. Thus, ad-hoc sessions and regular
        meetings that are scheduled for different times to use the same meeting number/URI.
      </p>

      <h2 id='settings'>Suggested Settings</h2>

      <p>
        W3C Teams has been asked to set up their default settings as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Join before host [on]</li>
        <li>Feedback to Zoom [off]</li>
        <li>Display end-of-meeting experience feedback survey [off]</li>
        <li>Whiteboard [on]</li>
        <li>Show a "Join from your browser" link [on]</li>
        <li>When attendees join meeting before host [off]</li>
        <li>Attention tracking [off]</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        MITâ€™s contractual agreement with Zoom was developed by a consortium of US
        higher-education institutions and provides protections for the security and privacy of the data.
      </p>

      <h2 id='testing'>Testing Your Connection</h2>

      <p>
        Zoom offers a <a href='https://zoom.us/test'>test meeting service</a> for anyone to use to test their connection.
        You should use it to hear how your
        own audio is working. This service may only work for Internet (not phone) connections. See also <a
        href='https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115002262083-Joining-a-test-meeting'>Zoom's
        article on testing</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id='recordings'>Recordings</h2>

      <p>
        Zoom provides the abliity to do video recordings and Chairs are responsible to ensure that participants are aware that they are
        being recorded when doing so. Recordings are made available after the end (could take a few hours)  using an email notification to the meeting host, and can only
        be shared by default to individuals with an MIT account. We're looking into providing additional recommendations to make those videos available
        through other means. Automated transcripts are made available 24 hours after the end of the call.
