## Reviewing
All W3C [RecTrack](https://github.com/nrooney/Guide/blob/master/mock/rectrack/index.md) Documents need to be reviewed. This page explains the review process, and how to reach out to the groups in charge of the reviewing for particular topics.

### Sections
#### Group Reviews
Group reviews occur throughout a RecTrack Document's time on the Recommendations Track. Please see the [RecTrack](https://github.com/nrooney/Guide/blob/master/mock/rectrack/index.md) pages to view when and how to hold RecTrack Reviews.

#### Horizontal Reviews
Horizontal Reviews are when you request a review of another W3C Group. Below is an explanation of these groups and the reviews they will complete for your document.

#### TAG
The TAG will do a general review of your document. They will be looking for technical inconsistencies and alignment with other W3C Recommendations as well as making sure the Document fits with the architecture of the web and supported by W3C.
