# Onboarding Information for Group Participants

## Group Specific Information
* Your group's Email list and its archive
* Your group's WebEx coordinate for group calls
* Your group's IRC channel
* Your group's meetings
* Your group's GitHub repository

**NOTES:**
* How to identify/get group specific information?
* Maybe we could use a table to specify group specific resources, e.g., group pages, wikis, ML, WebEx coordinate, IRC, and GitHub repo.
* It is encouraged to reuse our [generic page template](https://w3c.github.io/design/templates/), the
  [WG-specific template](https://w3c.github.io/design/wg-homepage/) and projects such as [the public API](https://github.com/w3c/w3c-api) and
  [Apiary](https://github.com/w3c/apiary/) (contact the Systeam if in doubt about how to proceed).
