<h1>Role of the Group Chair</h1>

The W3C Director appoints (or re-appoints) a Chair (or more than one co-Chair) "Chair" for every Working
Group and Interest Group ("Group"). The Chair's primary role is to
facilitate <a href="/Consortium/Process/policies.html#Consensus">consensus</a>-building among Group members. The Chair works together with
 the W3C <a href=
"staff-contact.html">Staff Contact</a>. Key roles of the Group
Chair are listed below. Additional information on the role of the
Group Chair is in <a href="../Consortium/Process/groups.html#GAGeneral">W3C Process
Document</a>.
<p>See also: <a href="reagles-experiences.html">On Chairing a
group</a>, Joseph Reagle</p>
<p>The team contact should
arrange for the Chair and the Director to meet (by phone if necessary) to make sure
they're on the same wavelength about things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>where the group's work fits into <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/">Web Architecture</a></li>
<li>where does it fit with other groups</li>
<li>testing, test suites ... generating tests as you come to
each</li>
<li>responsibility not just to the group -- working toward consensus
of the whole community</li>
<li>cost of delaying wider consensus - negotiating your reviews and
really getting in touch with people - versus time to market and specification relevance</li>
<li>formal objections, i.e. the tricky bits of W3C process</li>
</ul>
<p>and the team contact should make sure the chair is in the
<a href="/2000/09/dbwg/details?group=31972">chairs group</a>.</p>

including potential competitors) to forge consensus fairly and
without bias from your affiliation/employer and, sometimes, even
your own technical positions.</li>
